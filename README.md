## Overview

This project delivers a **responsive personal website** designed for **Albert Einstein**, developed as part of a full-stack web development engagement. The goal was to interpret client requirements, design an elegant and scalable interface, and build a professional, grid-based website that showcases Einstein’s biography, notable works, and publications while maintaining readability and responsiveness across devices.

The final deliverable includes a **functional static website**, a **wireframe prototype**, and deployment to **Netlify** for public accessibility.

## Project Objectives

- Translate client requirements into a modern, functional web design.  
- Utilize **CSS Grid** for a flexible, scalable layout.  
- Maintain consistent appearance across small laptops, large screens, and mobile devices.  
- Implement **responsive design** for mobile and iPhone readability.  
- Create a structure that allows for **easy content expansion** as more materials are added.  

---

## Key Features

- **Elegant minimalist design** using subtle, neutral color tones.  
- **Hero section** featuring Einstein’s iconic photo and brief biography.  
- **Publications section** with distinct, card-style blocks for each paper.  
- **Expandable layout** allowing future additions (new papers, blogs, or galleries).  
- **Responsive typography and layout** optimized for readability across devices.  
- **Clean, semantic HTML structure** with accessibility and proper alt text.  
- **Optimized for iPhone readability**, addressing viewport and scaling issues.  
- **Deployed via Netlify** for global hosting and fast performance.

## Technical Implementation

- **Frontend Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)  
- **Layout System:** CSS Grid  
- **Responsive Design:** Implemented with `auto-fit`, `minmax()`, and `clamp()` functions.  
- **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, and contrast-compliant color scheme.  
- **Performance Optimization:** Fluid image handling (`max-width: 100%; height: auto;`).  
- **Scalability:** Grid and modular structure for future expansion.  

---

## Responsiveness & Mobile Optimization

To ensure optimal readability and usability on mobile devices (including iPhones):

- Added a proper **meta viewport** tag for scaling.  
- Used **fluid typography** with the CSS `clamp()` function.  
- Set grid to **auto-fit** columns that collapse gracefully on smaller screens.  
- Prevented horizontal scrolling through fluid containers.  
- Optimized spacing, line-height, and font sizes for smaller displays.

## Deployment

The site is deployed on **Netlify**, utilizing Git-based deployment for simplicity and automation.

**Steps:**
1. Connect GitHub repository to Netlify.  
2. Use default branch as the build source.  
3. No build command required (static site).  
4. Publish directory: `/`  
5. Deploy and confirm public accessibility.

**Repository:** [Web-Database-Midterm-Website](https://github.com/GokuSSGodd/Web-Database-Midterm-Website)  
**Live Deployment:** _Add your Netlify URL here once deployed_

## Wireframe Design

A detailed wireframe was created in **draw.io** to visualize structure and layout before implementation.  
It illustrates the hierarchy of the hero image, content blocks, and responsive grid design.

## Scalability & Maintenance

The website’s modular structure allows for simple maintenance and expansion:

- Each publication is a standalone **grid card**, easily duplicated.  
- New sections (e.g., blog, gallery) can be added without altering core layout.  
- CSS Grid ensures future scalability without breaking structure.  
- Codebase is lightweight and easy to manage for future updates.
